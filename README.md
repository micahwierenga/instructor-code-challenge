## WDI Instructor Code Challenge

### GOAL 

> Create a single page application that will utilize an external API to request movie data. The client side application will be served by a back-end which will have the ability to persist data.

#### Back-end Instructions

- Within this repo you will have noticed two folders entitled `node-backend-starter-code` and `ruby-backend-starter-code`. Each of these contains similar back-ends written in frameworks respective to their languages - Sinatra for Ruby and Express for Node.

- Please **choose one** of the back-ends before you proceed. Feel free to pick whichever language you feel more comfortable in.

- Both back-ends contain several errors that commonly made by students, so you will need to do some debugging to ensure they are working correctly.

#### Front-end Instructions

- Use Vanilla Javascript to complete.

- The page should have a form that uses the [OMDBapi](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to search for matching movies and then display the results.
 - *Example*: If a user searches for `Star Wars`, a list of every Star Wars movie will be displayed.

- When the user clicks on a search result display detailed information about that movie.
  - *Example*: If a user is viewing a list of every Star Wars movie and clicks on `Star Wars: A New Hope`, detailed information about that specific movie will be displayed.

- Users should be able to "favorite" a movie and have it persisted via the provided back-end.

- Provide a link to display favorited movies.

#### Things we are looking for

- Clear, simple code
- Explanatory comments for beginners
- Consistent Naming Conventions
- Valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### Deliverables

- Please send us back a link to a git repo with the completed code challenge. 

- Include a README.md file in your repo with a link to your application deployed on Heroku or Digital Ocean.

#### Bonus

- Rewrite the application using a JavaScript MVC library. Include a readme that explains the benefits and any additional challenges students would face learning the library
